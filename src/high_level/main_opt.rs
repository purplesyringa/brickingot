        // an `if`/`switch`/etc., the current block's tail was inlined into that statement, and the
        // `break` was replaced with a fallthrough. Thus the `if`/`switch`/etc. must be the only

        //
        // One problem still exists, though. Normally, each statement is handled by the routines
        // invoked within `handle_stmt_lists` exactly once, but this process causes a single
        // statement to be handled multiple times. That's by design, since we do want to inline
        // multiple tails into a single statement. This forces routines like `inline_switch` to take
        // precautions to work in linear time overall, e.g. by not recursing into all child nodes
        // every time.
        //
        // `inline_expressions` is in a particularly interesting situation, since it recurses not
        // into statements, but into *expressions*; and so invoking `inline_expressions` on
        // a statement multiple times may be catastrophic. But it turns out that we're in luck, if
        // only narrowly.
        //
        // A statement that can be inlined to, like `if`, can only be handled for the second time if
        // it becomes the sole statement in the block; this means that it must be the first
        // statement in `out`. But `inline_expressions` doesn't need to recurse into the first
        // statement, since no definitions can be inlined into uses within that statement. This
        // means that `inline_expressions` will actually touch the `if` for the first time when it
        // stops being the first statement. But that implies that there is either a `continue` to
        // the block or the first statement contains a `break` and thus isn't an assignment that

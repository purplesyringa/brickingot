    // Exception handlers also affect control flow: we need to be able to travel from any statement

    // because adding the minimal arrow containing the guarded statements does not guarantee that we
    // can wrap the corresponding statements in a single `try` block.
    //
    // Consider, for example, the following input program:
    //
    //     print a;            \                                        |   : :

    //     goto 3;                                                      v   | |

    // 3:
    //
    // ...which is a variant of the following snippet, just with messier control flow:
    //
    //     try {
    //         print a;
    //         if (...) print c; else print b;
    //     } catch {
    //         print d;
    //     }
    //
    // The trivial arrows here would be as marked on the right with the symbols `|` and `v`, which
    // will then be extended by `:` (dotted) to maintain nestedness.
    //
    // Cruicially, a `try` block *cannot* be added around the first three statements because it
    // would get interleaved with the second arrow (corresponding to the conditional jump). This is
    // because the arrow corresponding to the `try` block -- the first one -- actually captures the
    // first 6 statements, which would correspond to the following decompilation, at least after
    // a good optimization pass:
    //
    //     boolean is_in_range = true;
    //     try {
    //         print a;
    //         if (...) {
    //             is_in_range = false;
    //             print c;
    //         } else {
    //             print b;
    //         }
    //     } catch {
    //         if (!is_in_range) rethrow;
    //         print d;
    //     }
    //
    // Such arrows are *sufficient* for AST to be built because we can always simply wrap each
    // statement in an individual `try`..`catch` block with `goto` to the handler inside each
    // `catch` -- with `goto` being reducible because we're within the range of the arrow.

            //     }
            //
            // ...but we *can't* jump across blocks, and we haven't indicated to the arrows that the
            // jump from `catch` happens from after the end of the `try` block. We could insert
            // a fake statement, e.g.:
            //
            //     a            |

            //
            //     dispatcher   | ^ |
            //     a            | | v
            //     b            v |
            //     fake           |
            //
            // which corresponds to code:
            //
            //     int selector = 0;
            //     while (true) {
            //         try {
            //             if (selector == 0) {

    // Our main goal is to get rid of conflicts, i.e. intersecting arrows. The intersecting parts of
    // the arrows can be either heads or tails independently, forming four categories of conflicts:
    // forward (both arrows pointed downward), backward (both pointer upward), tail-to-tail
    // (conflicting via tails), and head-to-head.
    //
    // The paper proves that all but head-to-head conflicts can be resolved by elongating arrow
    // tails. Such an operation only increases the set of allowed movements, and is thus lossless.
    //
    // Head-to-head conflicts, however, cannot be resolved by elongation, and it can be proven that
    // a "zero-cost" is impossible. We use a novel (or at least one that's not explicitly described
    // in literature) non-zero-cost solution instead: dispatchers. Conflicts are handled by
    // stretching the head of the backwards-pointing arrow to the tail of the forward arrow, and
    // then adding another forward arrow to return to the correct position. (In this diagram,
    // statements are oriented to the right rather than downwards for brevity.)

    //     <------------------------       jump to dispatcher
    //     --------->                      dispatch
    //
    // Immediately before the statement the "jump to dispatcher" arrow points to, a *dispatcher* is
    // inserted. The dispatcher reads a synthetic local variable, called *selector*, and either
    // jumps to one of the arrow heads, or skips to the next statement depending on its value. The
    // selector is assigned at the end of each predecessor of the dispatcher.
    //
    // This is kind of like a state machine, but a local one. If one part of a large function
    // contains irreducible control flow, we don't rewrite the entier function to use a state
    // machine, we minimize the impact.
